This Arduino sketch implements nethoncho's DHT22 code
(https://github.com/nethoncho/Arduino-DHT22) along with Tom Igoe's
Arduino-Pachube Client (http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PachubeCient).

Make sure you've installed the DHT22 library and set your Pachube API key and
Feed ID inside the sendData() method of this sketch.
