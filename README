This Arduino sketch implements Adafruit's DHT code
(https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) along with Tom Igoe's
Arduino-Pachube Client (http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PachubeCient).

Make sure you've installed the DHT library and set your IP address and gateway 
at the top of the sketch, and also specified your Cosm/Pachube API key and
Feed ID inside the sendData() method of this sketch.
